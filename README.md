# Color-Game-in-Python
Color Reflex is an adrenaline-based reflex game that tests your focus, reaction time and peripheral vision. Avoid the wrong move while quickly recognizing and responding to color matches in various game modes. A skill-based game that gets harder the higher score you aim for. 
On the screen is a text that reads out a name of a color which may or may not be the same as its color, Whenever the color name is equal to the true color text or button, you need to press that button. You have a certain number of lives, and if you mess up, you lose one; run out of lives and the game ends.
